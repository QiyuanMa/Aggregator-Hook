Hi there,

I’m Mike, head of DevRel of Artela. I’m reaching out to invite you to participate in our hackathon and become our early contributor.

We are building an L1 blockchain called Artela and successfully raised a $6M seed round in July 2023.

I came across your Hook contribution in the Uniswap v4 hooks collection, and we believe Artela shares the same vision of Hook design, which is to improve the modularity of on-chain programming and give autonomy back to developers. Artela is a blockchain network allowing developers to utilize WasmVM to build native extensions to coprocess with EVM. While Uni v4 hooks are application-specific, Artela supports native-level hook design, which is more cost-effective, computationally powerful, and provides more access to the runtime context. So that Artela can truly unlock more functionalities and in-depth customization for dApps.

We value your contribution to UNi Hooks and sincerely look forward to making you part of Artela’s developer community. Since your experience and work can be easily transformed into Artela.

By participating in our hackathon, you have a good chance of winning a prize and potentially receiving incubation support from a strong L1 foundation. If your contributed idea is included in Artela’s Dictionary, you will be able to participate in the prize pool and receive a contributor tag, which would be highly relevant to future airdrops. If you successfully deploy it on Artela or invite other developers who also make contributions, you will also earn bonus points for additional airdrop.

The hackathon will kick off on January 21st and run for 10 days, you will also be welcome if you can transfer your Uniswap Hook design to Artela.
